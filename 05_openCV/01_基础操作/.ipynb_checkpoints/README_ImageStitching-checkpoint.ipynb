    "The algorithm we’ll be using here today is similar to the method proposed by Brown and Lowe in their 2007 paper, [Automatic Panoramic Image Stitching with Invariant Features](http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous image stitching algorithms which are sensitive to the ordering of input images, the Brown and Lowe method is more robust, making it insensitive to:\n",
